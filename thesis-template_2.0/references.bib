abstract = {Theo Jansen mechanism is gaining wide spread popularity among legged robotics researchers due to its scalable design, energy efficiency, low payload to machine load ratio, bio-inspired locomotion, deterministic foot trajectory among others. In this paper, we present dynamic analysis of a four legged Theo Jansen link mechanism using projection method that results in constraint force and equivalent Lagrange's equation of motion necessary for any meaningful extension and/or optimization of this niche mechanism. Numerical simulations using MaTX is presented in conjunction with the dynamic analysis. This research sets a theoretical basis for future investigation into Theo Jansen mechanism.}

	abstract = {The condition for stability of a pendulum, maintained in an inverted position by vertical oscillation of the point of support, is derived by replacing sinusoidal motion of the support, as usually assumed, by a sawtooth or a parabolic approximation. The physical principles are unchanged but the mathematics is so much simpler that other customary approximations are unnecessary, and the complete range of oscillatory amplitude and frequency can be surveyed. The lower limit of stability agrees with other treatments and the upper limit, usually neglected, is determined.}

  abstract = {Stability assessment methods for dynamical systems have recently been complemented by basin stability and derived measures, i.e. probabilistic statements whether systems remain in a basin of attraction given a distribution of perturbations. Their application requires numerical estimation via Monte Carlo sampling and integration of differential equations. Here, we analyse the applicability of basin stability to systems with basin geometries that are challenging for this numerical method, having fractal basin boundaries and riddled or intermingled basins of attraction. We find that numerical basin stability estimation is still meaningful for fractal boundaries but reaches its limits for riddled basins with holes.}

abstract = "Numerical integrations represent a time-consuming element in the long-term dynamics analysis of mechanical systems. This limits the resolution of the computations and the dimension of the system to be investigated numerically. In fact, even pushing memory resources to their thresholds, only few tools can deal with higher-dimensional systems. This work illustrates, in a preliminary manner, the results that can be obtained reducing the aforementioned constraints thanks to the implementation of algorithms based on a parallel computing approach. In particular, by focusing on basins of attraction, four applications are discussed. i) The full domain of attraction for a four-dimensional (4D) system describing a linear oscillator coupled with a nonlinear absorber is calculated. ii) The variation of a safe basin with respect to the system dimension is then analyzed. It is highlighted how 4D and 3D analyses provide more confident results with respect to 2D analyses. iii) The parametric variation of a 2D system with a reduced step is performed by building a 3D representation which allows to highlight a smooth transition between the states. iv) A convergence study of a basin of attraction resolution is carried out. The integrity factor is used as a comparison measure."
