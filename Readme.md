# Guidelines for Bachelor Thesis

Your Bachelor project ends with an oral presentation and a written report.

## Presentation

The presentation should be about 15-25 minutes long and summarize the work you have done. You are welcome to also show a video or a demo of a prototype.
It will be held in the weekly group meeting, and at the end of your presentation, there will be a quesions/answers session of usually 10-15 minutes. Make sure to contact your supervisor for a presentation slot in the group meeting beforehand!

## Report

The report should cover everything you've done in the course of your project. A latex template is given in this repository, please use this. As a reference, the page count is usually between 10 and 20 pages.
It has to be written in English. Here's what it has to include:
- Thesis title
- Abstract: Summarize the scope of your thesis in a few sentences.
- Introduction: Introduce the reader to the topic by explaining the problem you're trying to solve, show why this problem needs to be solved, if other solutions to this problem already exist and summarize how you have solved this problem.
- Related Work: show what other work has been done in this field. Also show which papers, books, ... you have used to solve your problem.
- Your central work: Present the work you have done. Feel free to distribute this into several chapters, if need be.
- Conclusion and Outlook: Conclude the main achievements (or failures) of your work. What areas of further work and improvement do you suggest?
- Appendix: Anything that did not fit in the main part of the thesis, but is still important if someone wants to replicate your work. For example: more involved mathematical derivations, longer pieces of code, or algorithms used.
- Bibliography: All literature or other third party information goes in here and is then referenced via `\ref{...}` in the main part of the thesis.

If you have any questions about the scope, content or something else, make sure to ask early enough!
