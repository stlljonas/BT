\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook}



Implication that the system must be dynamical in nature (i.e. it must evolve). So a rudimentary control strategy must be implemented or outside forced must be applied. Don't quite know where to put this. 


further explore effects of combining disturbences of differnent sorts and the effects of the choice of bounds.

applying to systems of high dof with full phase space

apply to physical dimensions of systems (intuitively more drastic effects)

using the phase space as the disturbance space but heavily restricting it (actuator limits, improbable constellations etc)
