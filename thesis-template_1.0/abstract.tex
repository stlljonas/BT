This thesis presents a general framework for robustness quantification of nonlinear dynamical systems, including specific applications to quadruped leg design. The method is derived from previous work based on a nonlinear dynamics approach approximating the size of the set of disturbances a dynamical system can recover from. To allow for application to systems with high degrees of freedom, the validity of the robustness measure is restricted to chosen sets of scalable disturbances. The framework is applied to a quadruped robot model using two distinct sets of disturbances. The effects of varying disturbances and system parameters on the robustness measure are analyzed. Furthermore, motor parameters of the model are optimized with respect to the robustness measure using the CMAES optimizer.
